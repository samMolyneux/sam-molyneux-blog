            <figcaption>First camels of the trip spotted just outside of Agadir - a nice highlight after resolving my
                first mechanical of the trip. One of my pedals had worked it's way loose and by pure chance I was in the
                parking lot of a massive hardware store so was able to by a spanner and get it fixed.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>A big chunk of the day was spent between rows of large covered tomato farms. After heavy rain
                whilst I was in Agadir, I was lucky that this was the worst the roads got. That said, I did get my socks
                wet and lose the 200dh I had stashed there.</figcaption>

                dogs in the trip, something I would discover is a rare occurence thankfully.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>After the tiring costal track, I was fortunate to find Sidi R'bat, a small town with a couple
                hotels and a good
                tajine.</figcaption>
