            <figcaption>The last several years have been very dry in Morocco, this year has been very rainy so I'm
                fortunate to see things like
                wildflowers and other greenery.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Treated to a long gravel decent - the Moroccans are building roads like crazy though and I saw
                some construction workers at the bottom that would suggest this is the next track to be tarmaced.

            <figcaption>Beers can be a rare commodity in Morocco, I had a couple donated from another hostel guest
                heading back to Belgium (thanks Jim!). I'm still undecided whether it was <i>worth</i> carrying them up
                the mountain but it was a pretty great dinner.
